/**
 * Hardened S3 client factory.
 *
 * The default @aws-sdk/client-s3 request handler pools keep-alive sockets and
 * sets no request timeout that actually aborts. Against an S3 endpoint reached
 * through a NAT/edge that silently idle-drops long-lived TCP connections
 * without a RST, the pool fills with zombie ESTABLISHED sockets; the SDK keeps
 * reusing them and every reuse blocks until an upstream gateway gives up
 * (~30s) and errors. This is a latent hang on any S3-backed request path.
 *
 * Two things fix it, and both are load-bearing on Bun (the runtime here):
 *   1. `keepAlive: false` - never reuse a socket, so a dropped connection can
 *      never become a zombie the next request blocks on. Each request opens a
 *      fresh connection to a healthy endpoint.
 *   2. `throwOnRequestTimeout: true` alongside `requestTimeout` - a plain
 *      `requestTimeout` on @smithy/node-http-handler v4 only LOGS a warning and
 *      lets the request keep hanging; the flag is what turns the timeout into a
 *      thrown error (verified on Bun). This is the backstop for a genuinely
 *      stuck fresh connection, letting the SDK retry instead of hanging.
